<br/>
We are building website initially, for crypto investors in which they can use their existing Crypto Exchange to invest in this basket.
<br/>
For example: 
The investor can use Binance/kucoin/gate.io
Or any other crypto exchange which they are already using.
<br/>
The basket will be brought/sold at the exchange in which the user is using.
(They can use any exchange of their choice)
<br/>
<br/>
  This solution could could help investors from 
  <br/>
  1. saving time for research.
   <br/>
  2. Bearing huge losses.
    <br/>
    <br/>
As we expand,
We are also planning to expand this By adding Android,ios support.
Also we are also planning to provide Dentralised exchange support.
Eg:Uniswap.

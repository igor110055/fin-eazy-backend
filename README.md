We are building website initially, for crypto investors in which they can use their existing Crypto Exchange to invest in this basket.
<br/>
For example: 
The investor can use Binance/kucoin/gate.io
Or any other crypto exchange which they are already using.The basket will be brought/sold at the exchange in which the user is using.
(They can use any exchange of their choice)

  This solution could could help investors from 
    1)saving time for research.
    2)Bearing huge losses.
